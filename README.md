# guessingGame

Hello World page!!

In my Hello World page I am telling the viewer a bit about myself, some fun facts as well as some social media sites that I regularly use.
I added the links so the user could get to know more about me than is explained in the page itself, because contrary to popular belief I am not very good at talking about myself.

I also added a few fun Prompts to welcome you to my page and a fun guessing game with some trivia questions about myself.
I wanted to try a 'while' loop so I asked the user to guess a number between 1-5. If they did not guess the correct answer an alert would come up letting them know to guess again, if they answered correctly they got an attaboy for figuring out the right answer.

-In Rikki's page we added a table for the answers to the questions asked on her page. The table has two columns, one for correct answers and one for wrong answers. When the question is answered, depending on whether it's done correctly, an "X" is put under the column that it belongs.
-We didn't need to use any additional functions in Rikki's page because her code was already very simplified.
